Rotabrix Docs
=============

Use this directory for focused design briefs and technical notes. Start new files when a subsystem becomes complex enough that the overview in `agent.md` or `README.md` is insufficient.

Suggested structure (extend as needed):
- `systems/` – Gameplay systems such as rotation, drops, level generation.
- `art/` – Visual direction, shaders, particles.
- `audio/` – Sound and haptics mapping.
- `production/` – Roadmaps, QA checklists, release prep.

Keep files concise and actionable; link back to the main README for high-level context.
