Swift code for the watchOS app lives here. Current grouping:
- `App/` – SwiftUI shell, settings UI, crown input, and app-level controllers.
- `GameCore/` – SpriteKit scene, physics, gameplay entities, and level generation.
- `Support/` – Shared helpers, extensions, and configuration.

Organize gameplay code so it can later be extracted into a Swift package if needed.
